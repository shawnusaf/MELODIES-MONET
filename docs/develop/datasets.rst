Adding New Datasets
===================

Observations
------------

Examples for how to read in data from Aeronet, AirNow, and Improve are in the
``examples/process_obs`` folder in the MELODIES MONET repository
`on GitHub <https://github.com/NOAA-CSL/MELODIES-MONET>`__.
Use these examples as reference in order to add new surface observational datasets.

Instructions for reading in aircraft and satellite observations are under development. 

If you are interested in converting a new observational dataset to our netCDF format,
please see the notes below.

* The dataset should have these dimensions (in this order):

  - ``time``
  - ``y`` (an optional singleton dimension, included for consistency with
    model surface datasets)
  - ``x`` (the site dimension)

* The dataset should have these coordinate variables:

  - ``time`` (UTC time, as timezone-naive ``datetime64`` format in xarray; ``time`` dim)
  - ``siteid`` (unique site identifier, as string; ``x`` dim)
  - ``latitude`` (site latitude, in degrees; ``x`` dim)
  - ``longitude`` (site longitude, in degrees; ``x`` dim)

* This variable is required for regulatory metrics:

  - ``time_local`` (local time,
    usually local standard time, not including daylight savings,
    as timezone-naive ``datetime64`` format in xarray;
    note that this varies in both the ``time`` and ``x`` dimensions)

* It's good practice to include ``units`` attributes for your data variables,
  though this is not strictly required.
  Similarly, you may wish to include ``long_name``\ s.

* Site metadata variables (e.g. site name, site elevation, EPA region, etc.)
  should ideally be stored as varying only in the ``x`` dimension, to save space.

* If you have sub-hourly data, you may want to aggregate it to hourly,
  especially if different sites have different time resolutions.

Example abbreviated xarray representation for AirNow
demonstrating these qualities:

.. code-block:: text

   <xarray.Dataset>
   Dimensions:     (time: 289, y: 1, x: 2231)
   Coordinates:
     * time        (time) datetime64[ns] 2023-04-04 ... 2023-04-16
       siteid      (x) <U12 ...
       latitude    (x) float64 ...
       longitude   (x) float64 ...
   Dimensions without coordinates: y, x
   Data variables:
       NO2         (time, y, x) float64 ...
       time_local  (time, y, x) datetime64[ns] ...
       epa_region  (y, x) <U5 ...

You can examine the ``get_*`` functions in the :doc:`/cli`
(``melodies_monet/_cli.py``) for examples of converting observational datasets
in pandas DataFrame format to xarray Dataset format.

Models
------
Examples for reading model datasets can be
found in the ``monetio/models`` folder in the MONETIO repository
`on GitHub <https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/monetio>`__.
These include e.g., _cesm_fv_mm.py, _cmaq_mm.py, and _wrfchem_mm.py.
While a part of the MONETIO repository,
the private MELODIES MONET readers are designated with prefix ``_mm``.

Support for additional models is also under developed.

Standard variables are required to be computed in each model reader for each capability including surface, aircraft, and satellite as specified in the table below.
